set up a github account and create a new respitory

download git https://git-scm.com/downloads

in cmd run git clone respitory link in github

cd respitory name

should make a folder in local disk open that and insert a tf folder, a maps folder in the tf folder and a index.html

insert maps into the /tf/maps folder

in cmd do git add .

git comit -m "add comment"

git push

might have a problem with file size but should mostly work

on github you should see it getting added to the respitory after a refresh, goto setting and page, set it up 
to run from main and root it should run the index.html

after its all checked goto your server and in server.cfg add sv_downloadurl "website/tf"

the clients should now be able to download the maps
